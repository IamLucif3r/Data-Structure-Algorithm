/** Highest Palindrome

Given a palindromic number N in the form of string. The task is to find the smallest palindromic number greater than N using the same set of digits as in N.
Constraints:
1 ≤ |N| ≤ 105
Example 1:
Input: 
N = "35453"
Output: 
53435
Explanation:
Next higher palindromic number is 53435.

Example 2:
Input: 
N = "33"
Output: 
-1
Explanation:
Next higher palindromic number does not exist.
